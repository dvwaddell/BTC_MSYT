It initially provided an efficient CSV interface that got around the strict and old school format specification for the batch version of Tipsy. While many of you are probably familiar with the Tipsy Interface, BTC has a much different interface. Please note that this is version 1.4.2, Dec 9, 2024. Section - 2 BTC: Software Install &amp; Sample Data BTC is available here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/forest-inventory/growth-and-yield-modelling/ Clarify that this is the BTC stand alone installer. Copy to your local drive c:/data/localApps BTC1.4-20241209.msi [get name] Install to location: C:/data/localApps/BTC/BTC_1.4 Also grab the sample data file from [to be defined] MSYT_sample.csv Section - 3 BTC Input Data 3.1 Input TAB The Input tab is used to select Input format for creating yield tables Clicking on the Input TAB allows you to select the input file type and select the input file: Tick the radiobutton: TSR MSYT input format (.csv) Click the Select Files(s) button Note that clicking on TSR button will take you directly to: Select TSR MSYT input format files to import” 3.2 Select Report Type Note that the report type defaults to TSR Volume by Age. Other types of reports are listed but the main selections are: TSR Volume by Age volume, height FLP Volume by Age gross volume, crown_closure Selecting the TSR report type sets defaults for Utilization and OAFs (see below). 3.3 Select Output File Names Output file names can be modified as required, but for TSR: Input: MSYT_sample_input.csv Output: MSYT_sample_input_output.csv Error: MSYT_sample_input_error.csv Section - 4 BTC Input Data Format Once you have selected your input file the first few rows of data will appear. It is important to note that there are 4 main sections to each input row: 4.1 Identifier Section The first section supplies the row identifier (in this case feature_id), as well as the BEC zone and subzone. Note that BTC has a know list of BEC and if supplied with something unknown an ERROR will occur. The first column in the CSV is always the name of the identifier. Accepted values: Identifier feature_id opening_id id 4.2 Planted Composition The second section represents the planted component of the stand and shows: Planted Component Planted Species (1-5) Planted Species Density (1-5) Genetic Worth by species (1-5) Planting Delay Percent Planted (0-100) 4.3 Natural Composition The third section represents the natural component of the stands and shows: Natural Component Natural Species (1-5) Natural Species Density (1-5) 4.4 Other attribution The fourth section shows: Attribute Description OAF1 Standard OAF 1 15% OAF2 Standard Oaf 2 5% Opening_id optional vri reference age backgrow attribution vri ref density backgrow attribution Site Index values for all 22 PSPL species 4.4.1 Backgrow attribution The BTC backgrow function is used for stands harvested prior to 1987 only. vri reference age vri ref density The reference age is the age at which the density is derived. These attributes control the backgrow function to take a stand at some age and backgrow to derive initial starting conditions for a MSYT. 4.4.2 Site Index by Species Site index values for 22 species are derived from the PSPL data. Section - 5 BTC output Once you have selected the input file and the file type, click Start Processing 5.1 Output Screen Note at the bottom that it lists: file names Warnings and Errors. In this case there were none. 5.2 Output Format Output is single row per identifier, with: merch conifer volume (MVcon_) at age 0-120 merch deciduous volume (MVdec_) at age 0-120 conifer height (HTcon_) at age 0-120 deciduous height (HTdec_) at age 0-120 5.3 Height Height output is the average height. Beware of the Dr and At mortality OAFs. They can set the deciduous height to zero with unintended consequences. Section - 6 BTC Errors &amp; warnings If you are running BTC with custom data, you may encounter either a ERROR or WARNING messages. The count will appear in the processing window. There are warnings for: site index too high site index too low exceeding maximum density for a species going below the minimum density for a species In theory, for the Provincial release, there should be no errors and the warnings have been examined and accounted for. High site, the site index gets capped at the max allowed. Reduced stems, means we’re using the max stems available in the database Low site if you get a warning, the species won’t be contributing any volume. 6.1 Specific Errors and Warning 6.1.1 Natural component in a 100% Planted Stand: Context Description Warning Ignoring TU Species information has been entered for the ‘Natural’ treatment unit which does not occupy any area! BTC will only ignore the Natural component of a stand when the planted percent is 100%. When planted percent is less than 100% the natural component is included in the volume generation. 6.1.2 Site index of 0 or NULL for a required species Context Description Error Site index out of range The site index for species ‘Pl’ is set to ‘0’, it must be a value between 5 and 60. Section - 7 LOG Files LOG files are written to the same location as the input files. They are given a date stamped name and can be read with any standard text editor. LOG files contain: Version Information: Program: BatchTIPSY Composer (64 bit) Version: 1.4.2.0 VerDate: Dec 9, 2024 SIndex: 1.54 Started: Jan 8, 2025 13:15:13 Database: Ministry Standard Database, March 2023 Report Type: Report: TSR Volume by Age MVcon {yr} Volume (Conifer / Automatic utilization) MVdec {yr} Volume (Deciduous / Automatic utilization) HTcon {yr} Height (Conifer / Automatic utilization) HTdec {yr} Height (Deciduous / Automatic utilization) Utilization settings: (Note that these are the defaults for TSR Report type) Utilization Group: Coast 12.5 / Interior 17.5 except PLI 12.5 coast conifer+deciduous 12.5 interior conifer+deciduous 17.5 interior PL 12.5 interior PLI 12.5 Oaf settings: OAFs: OAF1 Default 0.85 / Reading ‘OAF1’ &lt;&lt;&lt; read from input file OAF2 Default 0.95 / Reading ‘OAF2’ &lt;&lt;&lt; read from input file DR ‘Volume Curve’ = DR (see below) AT ‘Volume Curve’ = AT (see below) ArmV Default Off ArmM Default Off DSG Default Off DSC Default Off Section - 8 Model TAB If you want to check on other features, click on the Model TAB: 8.1 Utilization The default should be set to TSR utilization specifications. The default should be: Coast 12.5 / Interior 17.5 except PLI 12.5 This can be interpreted as: Interior Pl: 12.5 Interior Other Species: 17.5 Coast: All species 12.5 Deciduous Interior : 17.5 Deciduous Coast: 12.5 8.2 OAFs BTC has a variety of OAFs that are user selectable: In TSR, the following are the defaults: OAF1 OAF2 DR AT Note that in the TSR format, the specification of OAF 1 and 2 in the input data is required. Otherwise, OAFs are ignored. The other OAFs: AmV AmM DSG CSC require local information and are not normally used. We are using the OAFS provided for Alder (DR) and Aspen (AT). Note that in the volume output tables, you will observe the decline in deciduous volume. 8.2.1 DR OAF 8.2.2 AT OAF 8.3 Genetic Worth This is overwritten by the 5 genetic worth columns in the input table. 8.4 Table Specifications BTC tables are capped at age = 120. This was a group decision that included the Stand Development Modelling group, the YSM group and TSR folk. The default setting for BTC should be: Stands are capped at 120 years and the age increment is 10. Note that if input is selected to be TSR MSYT input format, then this is automatically the setting. 8.5 Reports / Graphs This section details all the information that CAN be reported on. For standardized TSR MSYTs, only volumes and heights are reported by age. Section - 9 BTC in true BATCH mode BTC can now be called using the command line interface (CLI). For an R session: # define where the executable is located exe_location &lt;- &#39;C:/data/localApps/BTC/BTC_1.4/BTC/TIPSYbtc.exe&#39; # define the input file input_file &lt;- paste0(base_dir,&#39;/MSYT_prov_current_input.csv&#39;) # define the output file output_file &lt;- paste0(base_dir,&#39;/MSYT_prov_current_input_output.csv&#39;) # define the error file error_file &lt;- paste0(base_dir,&#39;/MSYT_prov_current_input_error.csv&#39;) # define the argument list arguments &lt;- c(&#39;/TSR&#39;,input_file,output_file,error_file) # check that the input file exists if (file.exists(input_file)) { # systems call x &lt;- system2(exe_location,args=arguments) } ** Note: system2 is used so that a list of separate arguments can be provided. system takes the command a a single string. For a CLI (Command Line Interface aka CONSOLE) C:&gt; C:/data/localApps/BTC/BTC_1.4/BTC/TIPSYbtc.exe /TSR (input file) If no output or error file is specified, the standard names are applied. Section - 10 ERRORS and WARNINGS 10.1 Caution This has been a very short introduction to the potential set of ERRORS and WARNINGS. The MSYT Process provided sets of BTC inputs and outputs are error free. If you choose to deviate from these, then you may encounter additional errors. In general, a quick look at the requested stand attribution will provide insight into the problem. However, if the problem persists, then the Stand Management Group should be contacted for advice. 10.2 Help For BTC and TIPSY support, please contact: Stand Development Modelling Team Lead Catherine BealleStatland Catherine.BealleStatland@gov.bc.ca 778-974-5634 Alternatively: Growth and Yield Applications Specialist Yanguo Qin Yanguo.Qin@gov.bc.ca Section - 11 Questions?
